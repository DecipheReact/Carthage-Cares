# Introducing Carthage Cares, our team's ambitious startup idea that aims to revolutionize education for young people. We envision Carthage Cares as an e-learning platform that will empower students to access quality education and nurture their entrepreneurial skills.

We've designed this MERN website ourselves infusing modern design principles, including subtle elements inspired by glassmorphism, to create a captivating and user-friendly interface and through it we plan to offer comprehensive courses in various handmade and crafty subjects, ensuring a well-rounded learning experience.

Our vision extends beyond traditional e-learning. We aspire to create a platform where successful students can showcase their knowledge and even sell their own products. By fostering an entrepreneurial spirit, Carthage Cares seeks to open doors to a world of possibilities for young learners.
